This repository demonstrates a rare Node.js bug involving an unexpected token error during JSON parsing.  The error, "Unexpected token } in JSON at position 32767", typically arises when handling large JSON responses that are truncated or corrupted, either during transmission or due to a server-side issue. The solution involves implementing robust error handling and potentially using a streaming JSON parser for large datasets. The `bug.js` file reproduces the error, while `bugSolution.js` presents a solution using a try...catch block and improved error handling.
